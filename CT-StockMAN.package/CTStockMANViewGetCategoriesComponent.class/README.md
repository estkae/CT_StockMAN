Get main top-level categories for the selected channel. For EBay this does just get the top-level categories - getting all sub-categories would take a looooong time and would be better performed by a separate script. Shopify has custom collections - these are set on a shop-by-shop basis.

It should be noted that each time a 'get_categories' is performed the database is refreshed - existing data is overwritten.
